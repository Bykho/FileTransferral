# This repository is the precourser design to the SILO project. #

In terms of Zero To One, this repo represents step 0.01. 

### This MVP demonstrate three crucial components of the system: ###
1) Automatic File Classification
2) Adjustable GUI based on data inflow
3) Inter-system file sharing

### The next version currently in development will have the following additions: ###
1) Local hosting of SILO port
2) System-level file interception
3) Wider range of classifiable documents.

## What is the silo project? ##

The SILO project is a  initiative designed to transform the interaction between an individuals data and autonomous agents. It introduces an innovative solution to address a challenge in human-AI interfacing: how to identify and provide contextual data from users. Think of it like RAG but for an individual. 

The product itslef is a GUI that is reactive to new data streams, however on the backend it seemlessly engages with autonomous agents. We envision future iterations of Silo as the connective layer between your file system and autonomous agents. Suppose, your AI-lawyer/accountant/financial advisor needs a new set of your files, just enable that connection through our selective API and don't think twice about it. Connections are verifiably secure, selectivley anonymized, and pre-emptively authorized.

### Key Features: ###

Augmented Desktop Experience: SILO reimagines the traditional desktop environment by providing a modern, user-centric graphical user interface (GUI) that proactively responds to new inflows of data. The folder-file setup of a modern desktop is a path-dependent structure where old patterns of organization affect the categorization of new data. With the Silo project the desktop will become reactive to new data streams.

Efficient Data Aggregation: SILO's powerful backend system employs SOTA Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology preprocesses new data and then lightweight classification algorithsm sort them. An ensemble of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models  intelligently classify and categorize each document on the backend ensuring that your data is organized and standardized, saving you time and effort.

Seamless Integration: Our vision for SILO extends beyond just managing financial data. We're actively working towards enabling secure API access, allowing services companies (primarily fintech) to connect with your organized documents. This opens doors to enhanced loan underwriting, fraud detection, account management, and seamless integration with accounting software.

Expanding Beyond Financial Data:

While Silo's current primary focus is currently on financial data, our long-term vision is to make it a versatile platform for organizing and managing any type of document. Imagine a future where Silo effortlessly organizes your entire document ecosystem and allows for hired AI help to selectively engage with your data.
